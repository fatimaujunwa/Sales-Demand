## **📢 The Challenge: Managing Retail Sales & Inventory Efficiently**  
Imagine you’re managing sales for **a major retail chain**. Every day, stores face **two major problems**:  

1️⃣ **Stockouts** → Customers walk in, but the items they want are out of stock. They leave frustrated, and you lose revenue.  

2️⃣ **Overstock** → Some products pile up in warehouses, forcing the company to offer discounts to clear inventory.  

Both problems lead to **millions in losses** every year. The question is:  
💡 *Can we use data to optimize sales forecasting, reduce risk, and make smarter inventory decisions?*  

**This project explores how data analytics and visualization can help retail businesses make informed decisions.**

## **🔍 What This Dashboard Helps Solve**
✅ **Which stores are growing vs. declining?**  
✅ **Which store types generate the most revenue?**  
✅ **How do holiday sales impact overall revenue?**  
✅ **Where should we allocate more inventory to avoid stockouts?**

## **📊 The Power of Data: Insights from Analysis**
Using **historical sales data** from **multiple retail stores**, I built a **Tableau dashboard** that visualizes:  

### **1️⃣ Total Sales Performance – Are We Growing or Declining?**  
📊 **Total Sales:** **$223.9M**  
📉 **Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:** **-5%**  

🚀 *What This Means:*  
- Overall, stores **generated massive revenue**, but the **5% decline** signals **potential inefficiencies.**  
- Some stores **are thriving**, while others **are struggling.**  
- **We need to identify which stores are at risk and why.**  

---

### **2️⃣ High-Risk Stores – Identifying Business Threats**  
⚠️ **27% of stores are high-risk** → These stores **show declining sales and may need intervention.**  

🔎 **Business Impact:**  
- These locations **might suffer from poor inventory management, low foot traffic, or pricing issues.**  
- By identifying them **early**, we can take **corrective action** before they become unprofitable.  

💡 *Next Steps:*  
✅ **Investigate what’s causing the decline.**  
✅ **Adjust inventory, pricing, or marketing strategies.**

### **3️⃣ Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Sales – Is There a Seasonal Impact?**  
🎉 **Holiday Sales Make Up Just 8% of Total Revenue**  

🔹 Many retailers see **massive sales spikes during holidays.**  
🔹 But in this case, **only 8% of revenue** comes from **holiday sales.**  

🚀 *What This Means:*  
- The company **isn’t leveraging holidays effectively.**  
- There’s **potential to boost seasonal promotions and drive more revenue.**  
- **A stronger holiday marketing strategy could increase profitability.**  

💡 *Next Steps:*  
✅ **Run promotions earlier to capture pre-holiday shoppers.**  
✅ **Optimize holiday-specific inventory.**  

---

### **4️⃣ Store Type & Sales Performance – Where is the Money Coming From?**  
🛍️ **Store Type A generates the highest revenue**  
🛒 **Store Type C struggles with the lowest sales**  

🚀 *What This Means:*  
- **Store Type A should receive priority inventory allocation.**  
- **Store Type C locations might need a reassessment**—should they shift their product focus or change pricing?  

💡 *Next Steps:*  
✅ **Analyze store layouts and customer demographics** for Type C locations.  
✅ **Improve stock distribution to match demand patterns.**  

---

### **5️⃣ Inventory Risk Levels – Where Do We Need Better Planning?**  
📊 **27% of stores are at HIGH RISK of inventory mismanagement.**  

🔹 **Some stores frequently run out of stock.**  
🔹 **Others hold too much inventory, leading to markdowns.**  

🚀 *What This Means:*  
- **Better forecasting** can **prevent both stockouts & overstocking.**  
- **Machine learning-based predictions** could help stores **prepare better for demand fluctuations.**  

💡 *Next Steps:*  
✅ **Develop an inventory management model that adjusts based on sales trends.**  
✅ **Use predictive analytics to recommend stock levels per store type.**

## **📌 How This Dashboard Helps Decision-Makers**
🔹 **Retail Managers:** Can quickly see which stores are growing or declining.  
🔹 **Inventory Teams:** Can optimize stock allocation based on demand patterns.  
🔹 **Executives:** Can use high-level KPIs to make strategic sales & marketing decisions.  

💡 *Instead of making business decisions based on intuition, this dashboard allows for a **data-driven approach** that increases profitability and reduces risk.*
